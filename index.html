    <h4><strong>Write the F!@#$%^ Manual</strong></h4>

    <p>Writing documentation sucks. Not writing documentation sucks more.</p>

    <h5><strong>Who Are You?</strong></h5>
    <p>My name is <a href="https://zacharyflower.com">Zachary Flower</a>. I have been a software developer for seven years and technical writer for two, and in that time Iâ€™ve had the good fortune of working with teams of all sizes. Despite the size of any organization, I have come to realize that many productivity problems are really communication problems, and often focus on ways to improve engineering transparency through technical documentation. Unmaintainable legacy code, knowledge silos, and slow developer onboarding processes are all drastically improved by keeping clean, up to date documentation on the inner-workings of any technical process.</p>

    <h5>Where's the Book?</h5>

    <p><i>Write the F!@#$%^ Manual</i> is currently a work in progress, however I am a firm believer in transparency and open information, so am writing it publicly on GitHub. <a href="#">The Pitch</a></p>
