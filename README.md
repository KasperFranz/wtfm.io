Writing documentation sucks. Not writing documentation sucks more.

From making a business case for incorporating documentation into the product development workflow to creating functional, test-driven documentation; *Write the F!@#$%^ Manual* is the handbook for learning how to write high quality documentation without sacrificing productivity &mdash; or sanity.

## Audience and Purpose

This book is targeted towards managers, professionals, and engineers who understand the importance of documentation, but donâ€™t have the knowledge (or resources) needed to effectively work it into an existing product development lifecycle.

Writing high-quality documentation takes time, but (much like unit testing) lacks the obvious benefits that come with feature development, and is often neglected in early-stage projects. With this book, the reader will receive the tools needed to effectively write technical documentation, and will provide specific examples of how documentation can be used to improve project reliability and developer productivity.
