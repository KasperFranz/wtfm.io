# Generators

> Documentation generators are often used to parse structured comments within a projectâ€™s source code and output formatted documentation. My personal opinion of documentation generators is that they do for documentation what site builders do for web design. That said, when used properly, documentation generators can be an excellent way to ensure high maintainability of technical documentation with minimal effects on productivity.
