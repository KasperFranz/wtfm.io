# API Documentation Specifications

<!--

Due to the inherent technical nature of APIs as a product, there is a strong emphasis on creating well-designed, highly accurate documentation. This has led to the creation of several description languages for API documentation, which deserve to be specifically called out.

In this section, we will touch lightly upon the three major API documentation specification languages available today. It will be important to note that two of these specifications (RAML and Swagger) have their own dedicated API management platforms, but the focus will be specifically on their documentation languages.

- Swagger - http://swagger.io/
