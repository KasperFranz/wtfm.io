# TL;DR: Examples, Examples, Examples

<!--

Clear examples illustrate complex concepts simply, and should be used heavily to clear up any ambiguity. In a nutshell, examples are the TL;DR of documentation. There’s an art to examples that must be addressed, however. Simply showing a code snippet isn’t enough. As with comments, the *how* and *why* must be explained. Comparing and contrasting good vs. bad examples will be especially helpful here.
