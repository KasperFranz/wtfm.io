# Test Driven Documentation

> The Printfection API case study touches on an interesting process called Test Driven Documentation. This method of documentation follows the same workflow as described in the case study, but rather than manually building API clients to match the documented specification, the documentation is automatically verified against the API alongside the rest of a projectâ€™s test suite. This process is most commonly seen with API documentation in conjunction with parseable documentation specifications like API Blueprint and Swagger \(which will be covered in more detail below\).
