# PART 1 WHAT DOCUMENTATION IS (AND WHAT IT IS NOT)

<!--

The overarching theme of this section will address what methods of technical documentation are available and when to use them. These methods can be split into three main categories: code comments, an accompanying README file, and dedicated documentation. It is important to clarify here that, because each of these documentation methods serves a different purpose, many successful development projects take advantage of at least two of them (if not all three).
