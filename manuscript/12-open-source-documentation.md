# A Case for Open Sourcing Documentation

<!--

Everyone makes mistakes, and even the most well-documented project can have grammatical or logical errors in the documentation. While not a largely common practice, there is a big case to be made for open sourcing technical documentation. By empowering consumers to fix problems and add examples to your documentation, you can ensure a high level of accuracy and engage more deeply with your projectâ€™s community.
