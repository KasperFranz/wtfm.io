# When in Doubt, Branch Out

> What do you do when the documentation is too big to put in a README file? This section will answer that question by touching upon different solutions for separating technical documentation from the source code \(many of the tools to accomplish this will be covered in more detail later on\).
>
> This is a common problem, so we will be looking at the Laravel README and documentation as a case study on how to deal with it:
>
> * [https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/readme.md](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/readme.md)
> * [https://laravel.com/docs/5.4](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4)
>
> This type of documentation is also incredibly important to have when providing a tool for end users as well, even technical ones. While the purpose of this book is to discuss the overarching benefits of \(and methods for\) writing technical documentation, this will be an important point to discuss in this section as there are many instances where end users will not have \(or want\) access to code comments or README files.
