# README Driven Development

> README Driven Development is the process of writing the README for a project first. This is a great way to work out how to structure and build a project early on. Similarly to how test-driven development helps identify bugs that might not have been caught otherwise, README Driven Development helps identify usability issues long before they become a problem.

> Case Study: As the lead developer of the Printfection API \([https://printfection.github.io/API-Documentation/](https://printfection.github.io/API-Documentation/)\), I pushed for a documentation-first approach to API design. This allowed the team to get on the same page with the exact usability and structure of the API before writing a single line of code. Once the architecture was agreed upon, we were able to build the API clients in tandem with the API itself, using the documentation as our blueprint, which gave us the ability to perfectly validate the API against the documentation.
