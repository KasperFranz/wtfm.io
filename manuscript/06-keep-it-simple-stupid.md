# Keep It Simple, Stupid

<!--

Keep documentation as short, simple, and unambiguous as possible. Writing documentation isn’t about writing, it’s about teaching. Viewed through this lens, it is much easier to explain how to use even the most advanced platforms in simple terms.

As an aside, calling out specific examples of high-quality documentation will provide a lot of value (https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs is a great source for this):

- Stripe - https://stripe.com/docs/api
- GitHub - https://developer.github.com/v3/
- Underscore.js - http://underscorejs.org/
- Twitter Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
