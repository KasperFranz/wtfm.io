# PART 2 WRITING NOT-BAD DOCUMENTATION

<!--

When I was in the 9th grade, I had an English teacher who taught me to always assume my reader is lazy, stupid, and mean. In other words, don’t use ten words when five will do, don’t use a big word when a small one still gets the point across, and above all else, avoid ambiguity. That piece of advice is particularly useful when dealing with technical writing, as it is painfully easy to confuse even the most advanced reader. This section will focus on applying those three reader traits to technical documentation.
