# Always Be Commenting

> While there are countless tools that add more value to code comments \(these will be addressed in the Tools of the Trade section later\), the main purpose of code comments is to explain _how_ a particular piece of code works, and _why_ it was written that way.

This, unfortunately, doesn’t add any value because in most cases, what the code is doing is pretty self-evident. On the flip side, just because you can identify what a piece of code is doing, that doesn’t mean how it works or why it was written that way is obvious.

In an industry filled with flame wars like VIM versus Emacs and PHP versus... well... everyone, one of the most surprising hot button issues is whether or not developers should write code comments.
