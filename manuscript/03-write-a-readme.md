# Write a README

<!--

A requirement under the GNU Coding Standards, a project’s README file should explain (at the very least) the minimum information necessary to utilize a software package. Thanks to the popularity of code hosting communities like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, the README file has a significant amount of visibility and power within most open source projects.

Common README template:

- Installation
- Configuration
- Requirements
- Examples
- Contributing
- Testing
- Licensing

## Description + History

The GNU Coding Standards explicitly requires a README file containing – at the very least – some basic information about what the package does and how it works.<sup>[1](#sources)</sup>

> The distribution should contain a file named README with a general overview of the package:
> - the name of the package;
> - the version number of the package, or refer to where in the package the version can be found;
> - a general description of what the package does;
> - a reference to the file INSTALL, which should in turn contain an explanation of the installation procedure;
> - a brief explanation of any unusual top-level directories or files, or other hints for readers to find their way around the source;
> - a reference to the file which contains the copying conditions. The GNU GPL, if used, should be in a file called COPYING. If the GNU LGPL is used, it should be in a file called COPYING.LESSER.

- Further Reading
- Contributing
- Testing
- Licensing

## Visibility

### Hosting

- GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab

### Formatting

- Markdown, plain text, etc.

#### Usability & Design

- Badges
- Screenshots & Animations
- Code Highlighting
- Links

## Approaches

### Minimal information with link to more detailed documentation (best for monolithic projects)

- Case Study: [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)

### Detailed information (best for narrowly scoped projects and libraries)

- Case Study: [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops)

#### Caution: Don't get too detailed

- Case Study: [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie)
