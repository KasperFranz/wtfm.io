# Quality over Quantity

<!--

Quality over quantity is something most developers strive for. It’s not the amount of code you write, but how well that code works. This same standard should be applied to documentation as well. Commenting every line of code or going overboard with redundant examples doesn’t add any value and only serves to confuse the reader. Don’t document things that don’t need to be documented (avoid write-only documentation).
