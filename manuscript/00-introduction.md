“Good Code Is Subjective, Documentation Is Not”

Writing technical documentation is like going to the dentist; you know you’re supposed to do it, but you don’t really want to. The problem with writing documentation is that it takes time, which pulls away from the job of writing code. Unfortunately, this attitude bleeds into every corner of an organization, reinforcing phrases like “good code doesn’t need documentation” and ultimately resulting in an unmaintainable legacy codebase.

This section will dispel the “code as documentation” myth, and make a business case for prioritizing technical documentation within the product development lifecycle.

Specific points to be addressed:

- Clear and understandable documentation reduces developer onboarding time, which in turn builds a more informed, more productive organization
- Documentation is a professional courtesy for the next developer who has to work with your code
- Documentation prevents “knowledge silos” - a situation where specific areas of a codebase are only maintained and understood by one engineer

As an aside, this is a great anecdote about how poor documentation can have dire consequences - https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5u2yra/the_time_i_killed_an_entire_company/
