Good code is subjective. Documentation is not.

Let's face it, writing technical documentation is like going to the dentist; you know you’re supposed to do it, but you _really_ don’t want to. The problem with writing documentation is that it takes time, which pulls away from the job of writing _code_. Unfortunately, this attitude bleeds into every corner of an organization, reinforcing phrases like “good code doesn’t need documentation” and ultimately resulting in an unmaintainable legacy codebase.

## What Is Covered

The topics covered in this book range from the benefits of documentation all the way to writing and publishing it:

* Establishing clear business cases for establishing and maintaining accurate and clean documentation.
* Identifying the consequences of _not_ having up-to-date documentation.
* Providing case studies to illustrate "good" and "bad" documentation.
* Practical techniques for weaving documentation directly into your product development lifecycle.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for managers, professionals, and engineers who understand the importance of documentation, but don’t have the knowledge — or resources — needed to effectively work it into an existing product development lifecycle. In other words, if you write documentation for a living, this book probably doesn't have much to teach you.

Much like unit testing, writing high-quality documentation takes time, but has a difficult-to-measure return on investment. _Write the F!@\#$%^ Manual_ provides the tools and techniques necessary to write and encourage quality technical documentation for any size project, within any size organization.

## Basic Structure

The chapters of this book are organized into four parts:

### What Documentation Is \(and What It Is Not\)

The overarching theme of this section will address what methods of technical documentation are available, and when to use them. These methods can be split into four main categories: code comments, an accompanying README file, dedicated documentation, and a change log. It is important to clarify here that, because each of these documentation methods serves a different purpose, many successful development projects take advantage of at least two of them \(if not all four\).

### Writing Not-Bad Documentation

### Make Documentation Great Again

### Tools of the Trade

Additionally, each chapter will include the following subsections:

### TL;DR

### Further Reading

### Questions & Exercises
