# Introduction

Good code is subjective. Documentation is not.

Let's face it, writing technical documentation is like going to the dentist; you know you’re supposed to do it, but you _really_ don’t want to. The problem with writing documentation is that it takes time, which pulls away from the job of writing _code_. Unfortunately, this attitude bleeds into every corner of an organization, reinforcing phrases like “good code doesn’t need documentation” and ultimately resulting in an unmaintainable legacy codebase.

This book hopes to change that.

As much as it is a creative endeavor, software development is also the act of communication. As programmers, we are taught early on that code is the language of the computer. By writing down brackets and algorithms, conditionals and objects, we are opening a dialog with the computer itself. With these languages, we can accomplish anything. Our words become the foundation for self-driving cars, virtual worlds, and someday even life itself.

But... these words aren't meant for us. They're meant for the machines.

Where we use code to communicate with the computer, it is documentation that we use to communicate with our peers. Like the Rosetta Stone, documentation is the link between the who, what, where, when, and why of the code, and the code itself. I think, as engineers, we have a tendency to devalue documentation because we don't feel qualified as writers; but, again like the Rosetta Stone, documentation isn't about _writing_. It's about _communication._

And, despite the title of this book, _Write the F!@\#$%^ Manual_ isn't about writing. It's about learning how to explain our code in a way that _everyone_ can understand it.

## What Is Covered

The topics covered in this book range from the benefits of documentation all the way to writing and publishing it:

* Establishing clear business cases for establishing and maintaining accurate and clean documentation.
* Identifying the consequences of _not_ having up-to-date documentation.
* Providing case studies to illustrate "good" and "bad" documentation.
* Practical techniques for weaving documentation directly into your product development lifecycle.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for managers, professionals, and engineers who understand the importance of documentation, but don’t have the knowledge—or resources—needed to effectively work it into an existing product development lifecycle. In other words, if you write documentation for a living, this book probably doesn't have much to teach you.

Much like unit testing, writing high-quality documentation takes time, but has a difficult-to-measure return on investment. _Write the F!@\#$%^ Manual_ provides the tools and techniques necessary to write and encourage quality technical documentation for any size project, within any size organization.

## Basic Structure

The information in this book is organized into short chapters that each focus on a very specific topic. The subject of documentation is as deep as it is wide, so not every chapter will feel relevant to you and your needs. That said, while they have all been organized in a way that makes sense to me personally, you should feel free to read them in whatever order you wish.

The chapters of this book are organized into four parts:

### What Documentation Is \(and What It Is Not\)

The overarching theme of this section will address what methods of technical documentation are available, and when to use them. These methods can be split into four main categories: code comments, an accompanying README file, dedicated documentation, and a change log. It is important to clarify here that, because each of these documentation methods serves a different purpose, many successful development projects take advantage of at least two of them \(if not all four\).

### Writing Not-Bad Documentation

When I was in the 9th grade, I had an English teacher who taught me to always assume my reader is lazy, stupid, and mean. In other words, don’t use ten words when five will do, don’t use a big word when a small one still gets the point across, and above all else, avoid ambiguity. That piece of advice is particularly useful when dealing with technical writing, as it is painfully easy to confuse even the most advanced reader. This section focuses on how to effectively apply those three reader traits to technical documentation.

### Beyond Documentation

Given the right approach, documentation can be so much more than just a brain dump of words and examples. This section covers different ways in which documentation can be incorporated into the product development lifecycle and how it can be used to improve the quality and reliability of the codebase.

### Tools of the Trade

While technical documentation is about educating stakeholders on the proper use of a feature set, there are a ton of tools that can make both writing and reading documentation easier. This section details tools \(and tool categories\) for automatically generating documentation, hosting well-designed and searchable documentation, and even touches upon the – surprisingly cool – world of API documentation languages.

## Questions & Exercises

Some people learn better by doing, rather than through study. With this in mind, the end of every chapter will include a set of questions and exercises to not only help you practice what has been covered, but also give you an opportunity to establish your own documentation habits. Understanding where your strengths are will help weave documentation into your development process, rather than letting it become a chore you would rather put off until later.
