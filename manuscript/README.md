# Introduction

Good code is subjective. Documentation is not.

Let's face it, writing technical documentation is like going to the dentist; you know you’re supposed to do it, but you _really_ don’t want to. The problem with writing documentation is that it takes time, which pulls away from the job of writing _code_. Unfortunately, this attitude bleeds into every corner of an organization, reinforcing phrases like “good code doesn’t need documentation” and ultimately resulting in an unmaintainable legacy codebase.

## What Is Covered

The topics covered in this book range from the benefits of documentation all the way to writing and publishing it:

* Establishing clear business cases for establishing and maintaining accurate and clean documentation.
* Identifying the consequences of _not_ having up-to-date documentation.
* Providing case studies to illustrate "good" and "bad" documentation.
* Practical techniques for weaving documentation directly into your product development lifecycle.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for managers, professionals, and engineers who understand the importance of documentation, but don’t have the knowledge — or resources — needed to effectively work it into an existing product development lifecycle. In other words, if you write documentation for a living, this book probably doesn't have much to teach you.

Much like unit testing, writing high-quality documentation takes time, but has a difficult-to-measure return on investment. _Write the F!@\#$%^ Manual_ provides the tools and techniques necessary to write and encourage quality technical documentation for any size project, within any size organization.

## Basic Structure

The chapters of this book are organized into four parts:

### What Documentation Is \(and What It Is Not\)

The overarching theme of this section will address what methods of technical documentation are available, and when to use them. These methods can be split into four main categories: code comments, an accompanying README file, dedicated documentation, and a change log. It is important to clarify here that, because each of these documentation methods serves a different purpose, many successful development projects take advantage of at least two of them \(if not all four\).

### Writing Not-Bad Documentation

When I was in the 9th grade, I had an English teacher who taught me to always assume my reader is lazy, stupid, and mean. In other words, don’t use ten words when five will do, don’t use a big word when a small one still gets the point across, and above all else, avoid ambiguity. That piece of advice is particularly useful when dealing with technical writing, as it is painfully easy to confuse even the most advanced reader. This section focuses on how to effectively apply those three reader traits to technical documentation.

### Make Documentation Great Again

Given the right approach, documentation can be so much more than just a brain dump of words and examples. This section covers different ways in which documentation can be incorporated into the product development lifecycle and how it can be used to improve the quality and reliability of the codebase.

### Tools of the Trade

While technical documentation is about educating stakeholders on the proper use of a feature set, there are a ton of tools that can make both writing and reading documentation easier. This section details tools \(and tool categories\) for automatically generating documentation, hosting well-designed and searchable documentation, and even touches upon the – surprisingly cool – world of API documentation languages.

## Chapter Extras

In addition to the basic outline above, each individual chapter will include the following subsections:

### TL;DR

> Too long; didn't read.

If you're the type of reader that prefers to skim a book, and then deep dive into relevant chapters, then this subsection is for you. It will summarize the information contained within the larger chapter without all the examples, prose, and history.

### Further Reading

Despite my experience and interest in the topic of writing documentation, so much of what I know has been learned from others. While I don't agree with every stance taken, I think it is important to know how my peers are solving the same problems I have, so every chapter will include a section with recommendations for additional resources on the subject.

### Questions & Exercises

Some people learn better by doing, rather than through study. With this in mind, the end of every chapter will include a set of questions and exercises to not only practice what has been covered, but also give you an opportunity to establish your own habits.
